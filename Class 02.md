# *Testing and Modules*

***Python Modules***
*A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.*
*To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension.py*

***Python Packages***
*Suppose you have developed a very large application that includes many modules. As the number of modules grows, it becomes difficult to keep track of them all if they are dumped into one location. This is particularly so if they have similar names or functionality. You might wish for a means of grouping and organizing them.*

*Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. In the same way that modules help avoid collisions between global variable names, packages help avoid collisions between module names.*

***What is PyTest?***
*Pytest is a testing framework which allows us to write test codes using python. You can write code to test anything like database , API, even UI if you want. But pytest is mainly being used in industry to write tests for APIs.*
*Assertions are checks that return either True or False status. In pytest, if an assertion fails in a test method, then that method execution is stopped there. The remaining code in that test method is not executed, and pytest will continue with the next test method.*

***What is Recursion?***
*The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi `(TOH)`, Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, `DFS` of Graph, etc.*
*Recursive functions are common in computer science because they allow programmers to write efficient programs using a minimal amount of code. The downside is that they can cause infinite loops and other unexpected results if not written properly.*

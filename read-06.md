# *How to use Random Module*

*The Python standard library provides a module called random that offers a suite of functions for generating random numbers.*

***Randint***

*Usage: Generates random integer values. This function takes two arguments: the start and the end of the range for the generated integer values. Random integers are generated within and including the start and end of range values, specifically in the interval [start, end]. Random values are drawn from a uniform distribution.*

***Syntax:***

``` ruby
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```

***Random***

- If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

> For example, a random number between 0 and 100:

``` ruby
import random
random.random() * 100
```

*Choice Generate a random value from the sequence sequence `random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] )`.*


## *Risk Analysis in Software Testing*

*Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks inapplications or software that you built and prioritizingthem to test.*


***Risk Assessment***

*Risk assessment may be the most important step in the risk management process, and may also be the most difficult and prone to error. Once risks have been identified and assessed, the steps to properly deal with them are much more programmatically.*


## *Big O Notation*

*In computer science, time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.*

*Big O notation is a method for determining how fast an algorithm is. Using Big O notation, we can learn whether our algorithm is fast or slow. This knowledge lets us design better algorithms.*

*Big O takes the upper bound. The worst-case results in the worst execution of the algorithm.*

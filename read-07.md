# *Python Scope*

> *Game of Greed*

***We have :-***

* Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

* Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.


-***Namespaces :***  A namespace is a container where names are mapped to objects, they are used to avoid confusions in cases where same names exist in different namespaces. They are created by modules, functions, classes etc.

-***Scope :*** A scope defines the hierarchical order in which the namespaces have to be searched in order to obtain the mappings of name-to-object(variables). It is a context in which variables exist and from which they are referenced. It defines the accessibility and the lifetime of a variable.

***Python Scope vs Namespace***

In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .dict.

# *Don't be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!*

*In computer science, time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.*

*Big O notation is a method for determining how fast an algorithm is. Using Big O notation, we can learn whether our algorithm is fast or slow. This knowledge lets us design better algorithms.*

***Def*** : <br>
***Matplotlib*** *is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.*
<br>

***IPython and the pylab mode*** <br>

***IPython*** *The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results.*
<br>

> And it combines two components: <br>
> -A web application <br>
> -Notebook documents


***pylab*** <br>
***pyplot*** *provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM).*

***Devil is in the details***

*The tick labels are now hardly visible because of the blue and red lines. We can make them bigger and we can also adjust their properties such that they'll be rendered on a semi-transparent white background.* <br>

*So far we have used implicit figure and axes creation. This is handy for fast plots. We can have more control over the display using figure, subplot, and axes explicitly. A figure in matplotlib means the whole window in the user interface. Within this figure there can be subplots. While subplot positions the plots in a regular grid, axes allows free placement within the figure. Both can be useful depending on your intention. We've already worked with figures and subplots without explicitly calling them.*

***Soo,, i saw that this is so interesting to know , it's like you are drawing your own graph in a paper in your own way , so you can control the colors , the shape and also you can use the animation there .***

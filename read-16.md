***1) Bird's Eye View***

> *This data science primer will cover exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and model training.*

***2) Exploratory Analysis***


>  * *The purpose of exploratory analysis is to "get to know" the dataset. Doing so upfront will make the rest of the project much smoother, in 3 main ways:*

  > - You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).
  > - You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).
  > - You’ll get a "feel" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.

***3) Data Cleaning***

> *Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning.*

***4)Feature Engineering***

> *  *This is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for 3 big reasons:*

  > - *You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.*
  > - *You can bring in your own domain expertise.*
  > - *Most importantly, once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise!*

***5)Algorithm Selection***

> *In applied machine learning, individual algorithms should be swapped in and out depending on which performs best for the problem and the dataset.Therefore, we will focus on ***intuition*** and ***practical benefits*** over math and theory.*

***6) Model Training***

> *There are a few key techniques that we'll discuss, and these have become widely-accepted best practices in the field.*

> *Again, this mini-course is meant to be a gentle introduction to data science and machine learning, so we won't get into the nitty gritty yet. We have plenty of other tutorials for that.*

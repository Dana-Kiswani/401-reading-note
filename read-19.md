# *Regular Expressions in Python*

*Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc.*

> *In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of `import`.*
`import re` 

***The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering.***

# *shutil* `High-level File Operations`

*Shutil module in Python provides many functions of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module helps in automating process of copying and removal of files and directories.*

***shutil.copy()***  *method in Python is used to copy the content of source file to destination file or directory. It also preserves the file’s permission mode but other metadata of the file like the file’s creation and modification times is not preserved.*

# *Getting started with Django*

*Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.*

***How Django Works Behind the Scenes***

*Let’s start with funding: why does an open-source project need funding?*

> *It turns out that while writing code is fun and developers are generally willing to contribute their time for free to do so, there are a host of decidedly less fun tasks needed to maintain and sustain an open source project. This includes handling any legal/trademark issues, triaging tickets, guiding community discussions, organizing conferences, managing releases, and so on. As a result, almost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:*

*1) Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well.*

*2) Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others.*

*3) Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.*

***Django Software Foundation***
*The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.*

***Technical Organization***

*The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.*

***Conclusion***

*So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.*

# *JSON Web Tokens*

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.


- *Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT.*

- *Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.*

***Payload The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.***

* *`Registered claims:` These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others.*

* *`public claims:` These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.*

* *`Private claims:` These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.*

***How do JSON Web Tokens work?***

*In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a `JSON` Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required.*
